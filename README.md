# Deployment Proof

This folder should contain either:
- A public URL of your deployed application (preferred).
- Or screenshots showing:
  - Jenkins pipeline run with successful stages.
  - Cloud provider console showing running service / task.
  - Application response (curl or browser).

For this example repo, placeholder screenshots are included.
